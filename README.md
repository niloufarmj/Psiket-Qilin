# Psiket Qilin: Quantum Version of Classic 2D Space Shooter

Psiket Qilin is a unique 2D space shooter game that combines classic
arcade gameplay with the principles of quantum mechanics. Developed for
the PsiKet Academy, the game challenges players to strategically
manipulate quantum bits (qubits) to defeat their enemies.

## Key Features

### 1. Quantum Mechanics Integration:

- The game features 3 qubits that players can control using
  various quantum gates:
  - X Gate: Flips the state of a qubit
  - H Gate (Hadamard): Puts a qubit into a superposition of
    states
  - CX Gate: Applies a conditional X gate
  - XC Gate: Applies a conditional X gate in the opposite
    direction
- By applying these gates, players can create quantum states
  ranging from 000 to 111, which corresponds to the positions of
  the enemies in the night sky.

### 2. Intuitive Controls:

- Movement is controlled using the left, right, up, and down arrow
  keys.
- The quantum gates are mapped to the following keys: X, Z (for
  Hadamard), A, S.

### 3. Difficulty Customization:

- Players can adjust the number of qubits in the game from 3 to 2,
  making the game easier with fewer possible states.
- The speed of the enemies can also be changed in the main menu,
  adjusting the overall difficulty of the game.

### 4. Visuals and Audio:

- The game features vibrant, colorful visuals and a captivating
  soundtrack to immerse players in the quantum space combat
  experience.
